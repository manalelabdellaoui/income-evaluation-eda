# Exploratory Data Analysis of the Income in US Households Using Python

This data set contains 32,561 rows and 15 columns. Each row represents a subset of a population. The columns contain socio-economic data. The data set can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lodetomasi1995/income-classification/).

We are interested in the relationship between various socio-economic factors on the income. Income is represented by two classes: The class that earn 50,000 a year or less and the class earning more than 50,000 a year. In the [first part](https://github.com/manalelabdellaoui/income_evaluation_eda/blob/main/preprocessing.ipynb) of this project, we checked the data for duplicates, missing values, typos and other inconsistencies and corrected them where possible. In the [second part](#), we went through all the socio-economic information and visualized and analized their direct relationship with the income as well as the combined effects of factors on income.
